# SportsTicker
Python Sports Ticker

Just me playing around learning Python and JSON

Huge props to https://gist.github.com/akeaswaran/b48b02f1c94f873c6655e7129910fc3b

It just lists Sports in Season and some scores.  Doesn't really scroll or tick, yet (waiting on rpi and panel avaialability).

just run espn-api.py and it should output data
